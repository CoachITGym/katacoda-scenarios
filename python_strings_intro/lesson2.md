# capitalize vs upper()

***Use the editor next to you to try these on your own....***

Initializing a string is as simple as setting a variable to a string-like this..

    name= 'Vedu'

You can capitalize this like so....

    capitalized= name.capitalize()
    printLetters= name.upper()

printing them will give you this...

    print(capitalized)
    print(printLetters)

Now, let us try a lowercase method....

    lcLetters=name.casefold()

    print(lcLetters)
