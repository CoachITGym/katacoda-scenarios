# Functions 

Functions in JavaScript are sub programs. They are in a specific kind of object. We will discuss objects later,  and we will revisit this idea then. For now, leave that in your head... if you can :)

So-- functions are a group of actions that you can do together. 
For example--let's look at this list of actions to multiple two numbers...
1.  Take in or accept two numbers
2.  Multiply the numbers
3. Return the result back

## Why is this important?

This allows us to use this block of code, over and over again, and also ensures that those group of statements happen in order. 

Based on this, let us do a small exercise. Click on the link below to open the file in the editor.  Edit the file, and make it work.
