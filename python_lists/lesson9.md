# Order

In a list, order is important.

Python follows that rule :)

In Python, a list is made by enclosing comma separated values of any datatypes (can be mixed) in square brackets… like so:

    `body_parts=[“head”, “arms”,”legs”, “fingers”, “toes”]`{{copy}}

*And, the List ordering is zero based in other words:*

 *“head” is at position 0.
  “arms” is at position 1*
