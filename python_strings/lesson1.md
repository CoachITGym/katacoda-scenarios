# Strings

**A String is a series of characters that are enclosed within quotes. As simple as that.**

So: "Hello to you" is a string.

as is: 'Hello to you'

**You can also use apostrophe's inside a string**: 'This is Neil's brother, Nathan!'

**You can also "nest" a string within another, like so:**

 'This is a "game". It's name is Fortnite'.

Just like `input()` and `print()` were functions (or methods), the string datatype has a lot methods that allow you to manipulate strings...

Remember an important thing!

Strings in python are **IMMUTABLE.** This means that they cannot be changed in place. When you use a method like `capitalize()`, *it returns (gives you back)* another string with the first letter capitalized. T*he original string is not changed!*

Now let's play in the next lesson.
