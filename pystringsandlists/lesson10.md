# Accessing items in a List

In this:

    body_parts=[“head”, “arms”,”legs”, “fingers”, “toes”]
    item1= body_parts[0]
    Item 3=body_parts[2]

### Remember Strings?

*Strings are a list of Characters!!!* Almost--- they exhibit a lot of property of lists, but are not mutable…so a lot will be familiar to you

So `len(body_parts)` works the same way as `len(<some_string>)`
